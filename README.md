MFC is more than just the biggest technical hub of VIT Vellore—it’s a thriving ecosystem of innovation, talent, and opportunity. Every year, we organize multiple large-scale technical fests that draw an incredible footfall of students, tech enthusiasts, and industry professionals. These events serve as a launchpad for brands looking to engage with a highly motivated and tech-savvy audience. By coming on board as a sponsor, you don’t just get visibility—you get meaningful engagement. We ensure maximum brand exposure through shoutouts across our widely followed social media platforms, strategic placements on event banners, posters, and digital displays, and opportunities for interactive brand activations. This isn’t just about putting a logo on a banner; it’s about positioning your brand at the heart of one of India’s most dynamic student communities. Whether it's through workshops, experience zones, or targeted promotions, we make sure your presence is felt. Beyond the immediate reach, this collaboration opens doors for long-term relationships, talent acquisition, and deeper industry connections. We’d love to explore how we can create a tailored partnership that brings real value to your brand while enhancing the experience for our attendees. Let’s make something impactful together.

If a keynote speaker cancels at the last minute, the key is to stay calm, act fast, and keep the audience engaged without losing the event’s energy. First, I’d quickly communicate the situation transparently while assuring attendees that we have an exciting alternative lined up. Instead of leaving a gap, I’d bring in an industry expert from the audience, a senior member from our organization, or even turn the session into a dynamic panel discussion or an interactive Q&A. If possible, I’d try to connect the original speaker virtually or get a short recorded message to keep their presence alive. The goal is to ensure the audience still feels they’re getting value from the event.  

For the long term, I’d focus on building a solid backup plan for future events—having a list of alternative speakers, creating more adaptable session formats, and ensuring we have strong communication strategies in place. Contracts with keynote speakers could also include contingency clauses for pre-recorded talks or virtual participation in case of emergencies. Most importantly, I’d work on strengthening the organization’s brand beyond just one event, engaging with our community year-round so that even when challenges arise, people trust us to deliver a great experience. At the end of the day, how we handle setbacks defines our credibility, and turning a challenge into an opportunity to showcase resilience is what truly sets us apart.

If a potential sponsor hesitates at the final stage, I’d focus on delivering a clear, data-driven justification for their ROI while keeping the conversation engaging and personalized. I’d highlight past sponsorship successes, showcasing real numbers—event footfall, social media reach, engagement metrics, and audience demographics—to demonstrate the brand exposure and impact they stand to gain. I’d also emphasize direct engagement opportunities, such as brand activations, on-site promotions, and digital presence, ensuring they see how their investment translates into meaningful customer interactions. To make it more compelling, I’d offer tailored sponsorship perks, ensuring their brand gets maximum value. If needed, I’d even arrange a quick call to walk them through these benefits, addressing concerns in real time and reinforcing why MFC is the perfect platform for their brand to connect with a dynamic, tech-savvy audience.  

Now, if a major sponsor pulls out last-minute, the priority is to act fast and stay adaptable without letting it impact the event’s quality. First, I’d reach out to potential backup sponsors—previous partners, interested brands, or even local businesses—offering customized, last-minute sponsorship deals with high visibility. If time is too short for securing a new sponsor, I’d optimize the existing budget by adjusting non-essential expenses, reallocating resources, and possibly introducing alternative revenue streams like ticketed VIP experiences or on-the-spot brand partnerships. I’d also tap into the event’s community, leveraging crowdfunding or alumni support if applicable. No matter what, I’d ensure that attendees and participants feel the same level of energy and engagement, proving that MFC’s events are resilient, professional, and always a valuable experience—no matter the challenges we face.

ques 4
When a potential sponsor requests exclusivity within a specific category, I approach the negotiation with a balance of value, fairness, and financial sustainability. First, I acknowledge their request and emphasize the premium exposure and branding benefits that come with exclusivity. However, I also assess the financial impact—if granting exclusivity significantly limits our ability to secure other sponsors in the same category, I present alternative solutions.  

One approach is offering tiered exclusivity, where they get dominant branding and prime placement, but we retain flexibility to onboard non-competing brands in a limited capacity. If they seek full exclusivity, I justify a higher sponsorship premium, ensuring the event doesn’t suffer a financial shortfall. Additionally, I highlight customized activation opportunities—such as dedicated experience zones, prime ad placements, or VIP engagements—to make their sponsorship more valuable without needing full exclusivity.  

If their exclusivity request risks limiting event funding, I negotiate category segmentation, where different brands within the same industry focus on distinct sub-sectors (e.g., one tech brand sponsors AI workshops while another covers robotics). Throughout, I maintain open communication, ensuring sponsors feel prioritized while also safeguarding the event’s financial health and sponsorship diversity. The key is creating a win-win scenario where they see the exclusivity as an opportunity rather than a restriction while keeping the event’s broader sponsorship ecosystem thriving.
